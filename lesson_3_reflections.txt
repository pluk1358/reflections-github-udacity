Question 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: for two reasons, 1) To make backup. 2) Share your work.

Question 2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: I think if it automatically update, it makes me mad because I want to
work on current version , not update version. For example if someone remove a
file that I want on GitHub and It update. I make me crazy to check older
repository.
