Question 1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: for two reasons, 1) To make backup. 2) Share your work.

Question 2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: I think if it automatically update, it makes me mad because I want to
work on current version , not update version. For example if someone remove a
file that I want on GitHub and It update. I make me crazy to check older
repository.

Question 3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer: Branches -> create new path of each commit. Use when you try to do something without affect current version.
        Clones -> copy repository from Github to your local computer. Use when you want keep repository to local. 
        Forks -> copy repository from other user to your user. Use when you want to get repository from other and can change it without change other repository.
